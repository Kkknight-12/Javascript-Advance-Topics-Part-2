/*
 * The OLOO (Objects Linked to Other Objects) pattern, as presented by Kyle
 *  Simpson, is a way of structuring JavaScript code that emphasizes the
 *  peer-to-peer relationship between objects, rather than a parent-child
 *  relationship. This pattern is based on the concept of differential
 *  inheritance, where objects are seen as peers that link together and
 *  delegate functionality to each other.
 *
 * In the OLOO pattern, objects are created by linking them to existing
 * objects. This is done using the Object.create() method, which creates a
 * new object with the specified prototype object and properties. This method
 * is a simpler and more straightforward way to set up object linkage
 * compared to the traditional constructor function pattern.
 *

//   function F() {}
//   F.prototype = proto
//   return new F()

/*
 * The OLOO pattern separates the declaration of an object from its use,
 * allowing you to define and lazily pass around the actual object
 * representation as a first-class object, similar to passing a class
 * definition around. Then you can initialize this lazily built, minimal
 * object with its full set of data only when needed.
 *
 * This pattern resembles the Builder pattern in object-oriented design,
 * which separates the construction of a complex object from its
 * representation.
 *
 * A noticeable difference with OLOO compared with constructor functions and
 * classes is that the reliance on the prototypal inheritance is much more
 * controlled and less exposed.
 *
 * When MyStore.isPrototypeOf(Blockchain) is true, you canâ€™t inadvertently
 * change the shape of all initialized objects, protecting you from
 * prototype pollution.
 *
 * In fact, MyStore and Blockchain are not constructor functions at all, so
 * they do not have a prototype property.
